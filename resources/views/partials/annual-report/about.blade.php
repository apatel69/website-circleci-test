                    <h3>Survey Methodology</h3>
                    <p>FreshBooks conducted the study for this report in collaboration with Dynata. More than 3,700 people who work full time—either as traditional employees, independent professionals, or small business owners—were surveyed online in November of 2018. Samples have been weighted (as required) to reflect various characteristics of their target populations (e.g., age, gender and industry) leveraging data from the U.S. Census, U.S. Small Business Administration, the NAICS Association and other sources. The study’s margin of error is +/- 2.3% at 95% confidence.</p>
