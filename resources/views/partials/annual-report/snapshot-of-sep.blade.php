        <p>Many self-employed professionals say they are driven to work for themselves by the liberating opportunity to completely change their career, or work in untraditional ways that even the most progressive corporate environments don’t allow. Others choose to work in the same field, serve the same clients, and in some cases, even work for the same company that employed them full-time.</p>
        <p>So who are the 15 million plus Americans who have eschewed the comforts and stability of traditional employment to work for themselves full-time? While they may share the drive and passion to be their own boss, their paths (and approaches) to self-employment differ in some interesting ways.</p>
