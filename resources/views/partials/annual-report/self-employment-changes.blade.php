                    <p>Here’s the thing: there are a lot of misconceptions about self-employment, which is why it's so important for aspiring entrepreneurs to connect with and learn from other entrepreneurs before they make the leap. So what do people expect once they become self-employed, and how does that compare to the reality of presently self-employed professionals?</p>

                <p>Next wave self-employed professionals expect to work harder, earn more money and be healthier once they work for themselves — but the experience of presently self-employed professionals indicates that some of these expectations will be more difficult to achieve.</p>
                <p>On the bright side, the reality for most self-employed professionals is overwhelmingly positive. The majority say they’re less stressed, have more work-life balance, earn more, and are healthier than in a traditional job. They’re also less lonely than expected, which could be due to a number of factors, such as the rise in popularity of co-working spaces. Which leads us to our next question:</p>
